                <h3>What is Hackathon 101?</h3>
                <p> We are proud to announce
                UTADA's inaugural hackathon!
                </p>

                <div class="about-content section-content">
                  <p>Most hackathons are focused towards upper-year students or industry workers
                      with extensive experience. Teams attending such hackathons do not welcome lower-
                      year students since they cannot contribute. We, at UTADA, believe that there should be
                      hackathons tailored specifically for lower-year studentsâ€™ skill level. While the
                      programming ability of first and second-year students may not be as mature, as former
                      first and second-year students ourselves and through conducted surveys, we
                      understand that younger programmer are very eager for such opportunities and are just
                      as innovative as upper-year students. Upper-year courses and the fear of lacking
                      participation should not be what impedes lower-year students from gaining hackathon
                      experience. </p>
                  <p>This event is designed with topics, such as AI and Python programming, that are
                      in high demand in the industry, but adjusted to give our participants an acceptable
                      learning curve. </p>
                  <p>The goal of this hackathon is to help lower-year students to be introduced to, and
                      be prepared for, topics that are seen in higher-level hackathons that they would not
                      otherwise attend, without the fear of feeling unwelcomed. We will do everything in our
                      ability to help them enjoy the hackathon experience to its fullest.</p>
